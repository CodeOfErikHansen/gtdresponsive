The inbox just stores text line items.
Then I need to organize them.
The organizer page needs to load the inbox contents.
I need to be able to send items to different areas
No Action
1. trash
2. someday list
3. records
Action Needed
1.2 minute complete
2. Project
3. Next Action

UX Flow
Stuff renders on the screen as a list
Each stuff has buttons next to it for how it is processed.
    -trash can
    -someday list
    -records
    -done
    -todo<assigns to project with a non-project for one offs
Clicking on any of the buttons will open up its own flow.

trashing it will hide it in database and remove it from front end.
option to revert if a mistake was made but no confirmation

Someday List will follow the project format but not tie it into the normal next action workflow

Records will allow bundling of records

2 minute complete is a no confirmation checkbox. Actions I have completed is a list I totally want to be able to look at

todo changes it to assigning the item as a project/to a project. Replace buttons in that row with the interface for this
I should consider that the note I made is not garuanteed to be the name I would want to give the project/action
I want the workflow on the backend to be that a Stuff is either completed, rejected or transformed into a record, project, or next action
I need status codes for this because I can either process a stuff, delete a stuff, or complete a stuff
Action items can completed or deleted
Projects can be completed, deleted, or shelved
Records have no status but can be deleted.

A useful thing I need to capture is the contexts when something is useful. That is a next action level item
