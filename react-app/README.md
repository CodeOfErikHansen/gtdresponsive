Remainder for app to be at 1.0
- [ ] Clean up styling before deployment.
- [ ] Spring Security
- [ ] Organizer can create projects with next steps 
- [ ] Organizer can create record with just a description
- [ ] Project/someday page has expandable items with the next steps
- [ ] Record page has titles that expand for description
- [ ] Hot Seat page has next steps grouped in collapsable contexts.
- [ ] Can drag and drop next actions in a project. Only the top item for each project should be in hot seat.(?? show follow up action)
- [ ] Allow tracts of work in a project. A project with multiple tracts can have multiple next steps, but only one per track.
- [ ] Can mark a project and actions as complete. If an action as part of a project is completed the project appears as a header for that item in the complete page
      If a project is marked as completed than all actions are also shown in the complete page. This is weird actually. Rethink it
