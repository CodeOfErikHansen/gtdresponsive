In this file I am going to come up with a number of records, one offs, and projects I would want my GTD application to support
The reason for this is that I need to find out if my general case works for what I want to use it for.
I do have the option to be creative in how I log it for right now.

Working on a Code Project
    A track is a feature
    A action is a story
Working on a book
    A track could  be a chapter. A track could be a theme
    Action could be items I want to include in a chapter or theme
    How do I capture research for a book.
Working on a webcomic
    Same idea as book. But I need pictures for thumbnails
    Pictures would just be nice to have really
Studying a topic
    Tracks and actions are an ok way to target new ideas to study. They do not capture the known information very well.
Buying things
    Unless I make a grocery list, this is probably just a series of stuff.
    List works as a track with actions
    CAn also use actions if prep work is needed e.g. find out pant size before suit shopping
RPG prep is much the same as the book related content.
Work tasks are perfect for task/action reminders. This is because I'm expected to store it somewhere else.

Preparing for a business needs records, tracks and actions.

I think the cool thing to do is have multiple subdomains for my different creative processes. I can host a different application on each of them
This will let me be more tailored to what I need.
This works because it is still the same tool for everything I need. I have just spread it over many different places.

General Conclusion: The GTD framework does not satisfy my need for a one shop application to handle everything I want to do.
I should finish it as a FVI based on my current understanding of the scope. I should TRY to use it for everything. This
will help me identify the pain points for myself. These painpoints are where I make another littlecase 'a' application.
